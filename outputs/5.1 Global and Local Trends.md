# 5.1 Global and Local Trends

As a premier computer peripherals company, HyperX, headquartered in the United States, is eager to broaden its market presence in Argentina. This expansion strategy necessitates a profound understanding of both global and local trends impacting Argentine consumers, including prevailing styles, technological influences, and the digital channels utilized by consumers.

**Prevailing Styles**

The computer peripherals market in Argentina is significantly influenced by the gaming industry. The country boasts a dynamic gaming community, with eSports gaining considerable momentum. Consequently, there is a growing demand for high-performance peripherals such as gaming headsets, keyboards, mice, and microphones.

HyperX, renowned for its superior gaming peripherals, is ideally positioned to penetrate this market. The company's products, distinguished by their sleek designs and cutting-edge features, resonate with the preferences of the Argentine gaming community. For example, the HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset, with its immersive audio capabilities, is likely to attract gamers who prioritize an immersive gaming experience.

**Technological Impact**

Technology is a pivotal factor in shaping consumer behavior in Argentina's computer peripherals market. With the emergence of advanced technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), consumers are seeking peripherals that can support these technologies.

HyperX can exploit this trend by creating peripherals that are compatible with VR and AR technologies. For instance, the company could engineer a VR-compatible headset that delivers a 360-degree audio experience, thereby enhancing the overall VR gaming experience.

**Digital Channels**

Regarding digital channels, Argentine consumers are increasingly resorting to e-commerce platforms for purchasing computer peripherals. A report by the Argentine Chamber of Electronic Commerce reveals that online sales in Argentina surged by 76% in 2020, with electronics and technology products among the top-selling categories.

HyperX can capitalize on this trend by bolstering its online presence in Argentina. This could entail partnering with popular e-commerce platforms in the country, such as MercadoLibre, to distribute its products. Additionally, the company could amplify its digital marketing efforts, utilizing social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to engage with prospective customers.

**Impact of Digitalization**

The digitalization trend in Argentina is also influencing the computer peripherals market. With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to more people working and studying from home, there has been a surge in demand for peripherals such as webcams, microphones, and noise-cancelling headphones.

HyperX can meet this demand by offering peripherals that enhance the remote working and learning experience. For example, the company could design a high-quality webcam with an integrated microphone, catering to consumers who need to participate in video conferences or online classes.

In conclusion, to secure a leading position in Argentina's computer peripherals market, HyperX needs to align its product offerings with local and global trends. This involves catering to the gaming community, developing technology-compatible peripherals, leveraging e-commerce platforms, and offering products that support remote work and learning.
